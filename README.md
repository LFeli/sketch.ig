# sketch.ig 🎨

**sketch.ig** is a creative playground for building, testing, and evolving UI components and frontend ideas in isolation.  
It’s not a UI kit or design system — it’s a personal space to explore logic, styling, and interaction patterns in a fast and expressive way.

> Ideal for experimenting, prototyping, and saving reusable interface logic.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Serve as a sandbox to test custom React components
- Explore UI patterns outside of core product structure
- Create a personal component library or visual logic lab
- Sharpen frontend architecture, animation, state handling, and design ideas

## 🧐 Notes
- I use it to try things before putting them into “real” projects.
- Some parts might look over-engineered — it’s on purpose 😅
- It’s meant to break, change, and evolve.
